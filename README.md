# Analysis of the Blazhko Effect for Field RR Lyrae Stars using LINEAR and ZTF Light Curves

### Abstract
We analyzed the incidence and properties of RR Lyrae stars that show evidence for amplitude and
phase modulation (the so-called Blazhko Effect) in a sample of ~3,000 stars with LINEAR and ZTF light
curve data collected during the periods of 2002-2008 and 2018-2023, respectively. A preliminary subsample
of about ~500 stars was algorithmically pre-selected using various data quality and light curve statistics,
and then 228 stars were confirmed visually as displaying the Blazhko effect. This sample increases the number
of field RR Lyrae stars displaying the Blazhko effect by more than 50% and places a lower
limit of (11.4+-0.8)% for their incidence rate. We find that ab type RR Lyrae that show the Blazhko effect have
about 5% (0.030 day) shorter periods than starting sample, a 7.1Ïƒ statistically significant
difference. We find no significant differences in their light curve amplitudes and apparent magnitude (essentially,
signal-to-noise ratio) distributions. No period or other differences are found for c type RR Lyrae. We find convincing
examples of stars where the Blazhko effect can appear and disappear on time scales of several years.  With
time-resolved photometry expected from LSST, a similar analysis will be performed for even larger samples of fields
RR Lyrae stars in the southern sky and we anticipate a higher fraction of discovered Blazhko stars due to better
sampling and superior photometric quality.
