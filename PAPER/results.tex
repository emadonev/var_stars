Starting with a sample of 2857 field RR Lyrae stars with both LINEAR and ZTF data, we found 136 stars exhibiting
convincing Blazhko effect. In Appendix A, the reader can find all of the Blazhko stars and some elementary data
describing each star. 


Another important note highlighting the difficulty of finding Blazhko
stars is that the absolute Blazhko frequency difference from the main
frequency is approximately 0.028 $d^{-1}$. Also, the average period
difference between LINEAR and ZTF in Blazhko stars was around 0.0001
days. These minimal differences require precise observations over a
long temporal baseline.  


Finally, we have discovered that in some Blazhko stars, the effect cannot be detected ten years later or beforehand.
When comparing LINEAR and ZTF data, some pairs have the effect present in only one dataset and others in both.
This finding could mean that the Blazhko effect is not always present and gives us a clue about its mechanism.
However, the precision of data is also a factor for consideration.
