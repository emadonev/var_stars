\abstract{We analyzed the incidence and properties of RR Lyrae stars that show evidence for amplitude and
phase modulation (the so-called Blazhko Effect) in a sample of $\sim$3,000 stars with LINEAR and ZTF light
curve data collected during the periods of 2002-2008 and 2018-2023, respectively. A preliminary subsample
of about $\sim$500 stars was algorithmically pre-selected using various data quality and light curve statistics,
and then 228 stars were confirmed visually as displaying the Blazhko effect.
This sample nearly doubles the number of field RR Lyrae stars displaying the Blazhko effect and places a lower
limit of 7\% for their incidence rate. We find that stars that show the Blazhko effect have a smaller fraction of
large light curve amplitudes than starting sample, with no large differences in their period and apparent
magnitude (signal-to-noise ratio) distributions. Analyzed light curves span two decades and show that Blazhko
effect can appear and disappear on time scales of several years: about half of all stars with Blazhko effect show
it in both LINEAR and ZTF data, with a quarter of stars showing the effect in each single survey.  With
time-resolved photometry expected from LSST, a similar analysis will be performed for RR Lyrae stars in the
southern sky and we anticipate a higher fraction of discovered Blazhko stars due to better sampling and superior
photometric quality.}
