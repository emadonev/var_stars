\abstract{We analyzed the incidence and properties of RR Lyrae stars that show evidence for amplitude and
phase modulation (the so-called Blazhko Effect) in a sample of $\sim$3,000 stars with
LINEAR and ZTF light curve data. A preliminary subsample of about $\sim$240 stars was algorithmically pre-selected
using various data quality and light curve statistics, and then 139 stars were confirmed visually as displaying
the Blazhko effect.  This sample places a lower limit of 5\% for the incidence of the Blazhko Effect in field RR Lyrae stars.
Although close to 8,000 Blazhko stars were discovered or confirmed in the Galactic bulge
and LMC/SMC by the OGLE-III survey, only about 200 stars have been reported in all field RR Lyrae stars
studies to date; the sample presented here nearly doubles the number of field RR Lyrae stars displaying the Blazhko effect.
With time-resolved photometry expected from LSST, a similar analysis will be performed for
RR Lyrae stars in the southern sky and we anticipate a higher fraction of discovered Blazhko stars due to better sampling
and superior photometric quality.}
