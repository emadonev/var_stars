\begin{abstract}
We analyzed the incidence and properties of stars that show evidence for amplitude, period, and
phase modulation (the so-called Blazhko Effect) in a sample of $\sim$2,000 field RR Lyrae stars with
LINEAR and ZTF light curve data. A preliminary subsample of about $\sim$800 stars was selected
using various light curve statistics, and then $\sim$200 stars were confirmed visually as displaying
the Blazhko effect. Although there are close to 8,000 Blazhko stars discovered in the Galactic bulge
and LMC/SMC by the OGLE-III survey, there are only about 200 stars in total reported in all the studies
of field RR Lyrae stars to date and thus the sample presented here doubles the number of such stars.
We found that$\|dots$
