\begin{abstract}
We analyzed the incidence and properties of RR Lyrae stars that show evidence for amplitude and
phase modulation (the so-called Blazhko Effect) in a sample of $\sim$3,000 stars with LINEAR and ZTF light
curve data collected during the periods of 2002-2008 and 2018-2023, respectively. A preliminary subsample
of about $\sim$500 stars was algorithmically pre-selected using various data quality and light curve statistics,
and then 228 stars were confirmed visually as displaying the Blazhko effect. This sample increases the number
of field RR Lyrae stars displaying the Blazhko effect by more than 50\% and places a lower
limit of (11.4$\pm$0.8)\% for their incidence rate. We find that ab type RR Lyrae that show the Blazhko effect have
about 5\% (0.030 day) shorter periods than starting sample, a 7.1$\sigma$ statistically significant
difference. We find no significant differences in their light curve amplitudes and apparent magnitude (essentially,
signal-to-noise ratio) distributions. No period or other differences are found for c type RR Lyrae. We find convincing
examples of stars where the Blazhko effect can appear and disappear on time scales of several years.  With
time-resolved photometry expected from LSST, a similar analysis will be performed for even larger samples of field
RR Lyrae stars in the southern sky and we anticipate a higher fraction of discovered Blazhko stars due to better
sampling and superior photometric quality.

Table 1: The first 10 confirmed Blazhko stars with their LINEAR
IDs in the first column and then, for both LINEAR and ZTF, their
computed  light curve periods (day),
the number of data points per light curve, robust and ordinary $\chi^2$ values, and light curve amplitudes, followed by amplitude 
difference between LINEAR and ZTF, the strength and period of Blazhko peaks in their periodograms, light curve type (1: ab, 2: c), detection
significance flag for the periodograms (Z, L or ``-'' for no detection; the strength and period of Blazhko
peaks are not reliable when ``-'' ) and the selection score (see Sections 3.1 and 3.2 for details). The full table is available in online edition.
