> Below, I list my comments and suggestions to further improve the manuscript.

Thank you very much for excellent expect comments! We have implemented them as detailed below.

> line 137: "The fractions of RRab and RRc type RR Lyrae in this sample, 71% RRab and 29% RRc type, are consistent

> Please also mention the Gaia DR3 statistics, based on their Table 10 here:

We have added a reference to this important paper.

> line 166: "LINEAR data can predict the phase of ZTF light curve 166 with an uncertainty of 0.2."

> An additional complicating factor here is that RR Lyrae stars experience phase shifts and period changes for various reasons,
> therefore shifts exceeding 0.2 can appear naturally, even on a 15 year timescale. This further confirms the need to analyze
> the two data sets separately. See. e.g.,

> https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017IBVS.6228....1D/abstract

Yes, agreed, thank you for these additional references.

> Section 3.2:
> Did the authors identify and/or filter out double-mode (RRd) stars?

Since their expected sample fraction is below 1\%, we didn't try to identify them, as we
now explicitly state in the paper.

We allow for asymmetric peaks (that is, we don't require identical peaks) but it is true that
the selection of highly asymmetric peaks will be low. We added a statement to this effect,
strengthened by the provided references.

Thank you very much for this expert comment! We added it to the manuscript, as well as the suggested references.

> footnote: "1 The Blazhko effect was discovered by Lidiya Petrovna Tseraskaya and first reported by Sergey Blazhko."

> I disagree with Don Kurtz's interpretation of Sergei Blazhko's German phrasing on this. My translation would be "Below are the results

We were unaware of this controversy. We rephrased this footnote. 

-----
> A stylistic/aesthetic comment on the plots: right now they're dominated by the error bars, with the actual data points being hardly visible.
> I'd suggest increasing the point sizes. I personally also like error bars without caps at the ends, but I leave that up to the authors' preferences.

Agreed and implemented as suggested.

> Fig 1: please include the period used to fold the data into phase curves in the caption. Also, the axis labels are a bit too large.
> Figs 8-9: please include the periods in the caption here, too.

Agreed and implemented as suggested.

> Fig 11: could you make the two plots equally sized? Now the color bar takes up space from the right plot, which makes the two distributions
> a bit harder to compare visually.

Agreed and implemented as suggested.

Thank you again for your comments that certainly improved the paper!
